# Drupal_Module_API_ConfigForm

This is my first custom module.
In this the aim is to 

1. Create a module in Drupal 8 with name: Node JSON Data, machine name node_json_data.

2. Create a configuration form in which an API key is accepted from the user. API Key will be a maximum 16 digit text value.

3. Create a controller with route /data/{apikey}/{node-id}, where api key should be same as API key saved in settings, and node-id should be valid node id existing in the system.
